# Carbon-Sequestration
This project was completed for Introduction to Engineering (ENGI 1100) in Fall 2018. This was mainly a research project in which our team looked into the different methods of sequestering carbon dioxide from the atmosphere in order to theoretically improve the air quality of Phoenix, Arizona. Each team member came up with their individual solution, then came together as a team to systematically choose which design was the best. We determined that Nayera's algae sequestration design was most suitable. This projet was a collaboration by Justin Francisco, Amanda Scudder, Thuan Le, Magdi Alameen, Yadira Rodriguez, and Nayera Ahmed. 

Our documentation is seen in the two other .pdf files.
